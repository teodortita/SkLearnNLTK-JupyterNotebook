# SkLearnNLTK-JupyterNotebook

Academic Project

## Description

I have written a Jupyter notebook in Python as part of an academic assignment for the Natural Language Processing module in order to develop a method for automatically classifying Amazon reviews as real or fake, by implementing a Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM). The project includes exploratory data analysis for hypothesis testing using matplotlib, NLTK preprocessing, feature vectors, model training, cross-validation, testing and evaluation. The F Score of this model evaluated to roughly 0.8.
